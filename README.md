# Python-Theatre-Ticket-System
This code is a simulation of purchasing a ticket at the theatre. The price will be displayed and when you buy the ticket it will 'x' it out in the seating arrangement. It will continue to loop allowing you to buy more tickets until you are completed, and then you can exit the code.
 
Shortcut - you can type all to buy all the seats at once.
